## Health at a glance

| Area | State | One-liner |
|---|---|---|
| Backend API (`apps/api`) | 🟢 solid core, 🟠 gaps | Phase 1 + recipe slice done, 66/66 tests. No publish lifecycle (SAV-129); 1 live-proven auth hole (L-1); goal-range bug (L-12). |
| iOS app (`SavoroIOS`) | 🟡 rich mock | Today/Log/Cookbook/Detail/Editor + fork flow complete on mocks, 204/204 tests. Discover/Community/Profile are stubs. |
| iOS UX quality | 🔴 fails basics | Dark mode illegible (L-15); Accessibility XXXL breaks major screens (L-16); jargon/IDs in visible copy (L-17). |
| Integration (app ↔ API) | 🔴 not started | Zero screens call the real API; live client exists but has no call sites (L-8). |
| Deploy/infra | 🔴 not wired | D1 `database_id` is a placeholder (L-4); deps have a high-severity advisory (L-13). |
| Tickets/planning | 🟡 local-only | Linear blocked; `docs/backlog-local.md` is the live backlog, git log is the Done board. |

**Bottom line:** the product core is well-built and tested, but nothing is
publishable, nothing talks to the real backend, and dark mode / large type are
unusable. Fix wave first, then progress wave, then first live integration slice.

## Strategy (revised 2026-07-17 evening)

**Scaffolding first, then one page at a time, fully.** Agents have no eyes, so
before more feature work we build the rendering/verification harness (XCUITest
journeys + snapshot matrix) that every future ticket must feed. Then we take the
**Today** page through the full ladder — UX → live functionality → UAT →
feedback — as the template for every page after it. Backend fix work runs in
parallel since it shares no files with the frontend track.

## Run queue (overnight loop)

Status values: `queued` → `in-progress` → `review` → `landed` / `blocked`.
Max one active ticket per track; lands are serialized on `main`.

| # | Ticket | Track | Status | Evidence (commit / run) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | L-20 — XCUITest scaffolding + smoke journey w/ screenshot artifacts | frontend | in-progress (fresh run from post-L-36 main; stale partial work discarded to avoid pbxproj conflicts) | |
| 2 | SAV-129 + L-1 — publish lifecycle, close public-draft logging hole, real `publishedAt` | backend | **landed** | `705510f`, 74/74 tests |
| 3 | L-21 — snapshot harness: {light,dark}×{standard,XXXL} matrix ("agent eyes") | frontend | queued | |
| 4 | L-12 — goal date-range integrity (no `endDate < startDate`) | backend | **landed** | `f36349b`, 78/78 tests |
| 5 | L-15 — dark-mode fix (Today + app chrome first), proven via L-21 snapshots | frontend | queued | |
| 6 | L-14 — log-create response matches contract (`{entry, dayLog}` only) | backend | **landed** | `e86cd9b`, 78/78 tests |
| 7 | L-16 — XXXL/Dynamic Type reflow (Today + chrome first), proven via snapshots | frontend | queued | |
| 8 | L-17 — remove jargon/raw IDs/banned words from visible copy | frontend | queued | |
| 9 | L-23 — vertical slice: Today live against local Worker (auth, day log, goals, log create) | integration | queued — gated on #1 and #3 | |
| 10 | L-24 — Today UAT bundle for Dylan (checklist + screenshots + limitations) | human-in-loop | queued — gated on #9 | |
| 11 | SAV-131 — cookbook save/unsave + mine/saved/drafts endpoints | backend | in-progress | |
| 12 | **L-36 — TestFlight readiness (icon, plist, mock-mode Release, archive check, morning checklist) — MUST land tonight** | frontend | **landed** | `b851a2f`, 204/204 + Release archive OK; checklist at SavoroIOS/TestFlightChecklist.md |
| 13 | L-35 — UI consistency guardrails (primitives, layout regression tests, token lint) | frontend | queued | |

L-18 is superseded by #1/#3 (mock tier) and #9 (live tier).

**Stretch queue** (if the main queue drains before morning, keep going — feature
work continues; only UAT-gated items park):

| # | Ticket | Track | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | L-3 — discover/search endpoints (gated on #2 SAV-129) | backend | queued |
| S2 | SAV-133 — profiles/usernames endpoints | backend | queued |
| S3 | L-2 — logs management endpoints | backend | queued |
| S4 | SAV-72 — editor save/publish UX (mock-first) | frontend | queued |
| S5 | L-25 — sign-in/onboarding screen (mock-first) | frontend | queued |
| S6 | L-5 — Discover tab UI (mock-first, standard rails) | frontend | queued |
| S7 | L-28 — follow/friends + activity backend | backend | queued |
| S8 | L-37 — port USDA foods to D1 + foods search endpoints (replaces research half of L-3) | backend | queued |

Note: #10 (Today UAT) parks only the *integration* ladder until Dylan responds;
backend/frontend tracks keep working the stretch queue.

## Roadmap — every page, mapped (as of 2026-07-17)

Slices follow the Today template: UX → live wiring → UAT → feedback.

| Page / surface | UI now | Backend now | Path to done |
|---|---|---|---|
| Today + log sheets | 🟡 rich mock | 🟢 done | **Slice 1 tonight** (L-23→L-24) |
| Recipe Detail / Editor / publish | 🟡 rich mock | 🟠 publish missing | SAV-129 (tonight) + SAV-72 → **Slice 2** (L-31) |
| Cookbook | 🟡 rich mock | 🔴 SAV-131 | SAV-131 (tonight) → **Slice 3** (L-30) |
| Food search in picker | 🟡 mock | 🔴 L-3 | L-3 → joins Slice 1 follow-up |
| Discover | 🔴 stub | 🔴 L-3 | L-5 + L-3 → **Slice 4** (L-32) |
| Sign-in / onboarding | 🔴 doesn't exist | 🟢 Apple auth done | L-25 → L-26 (real Apple needs Dylan's dev account) |
| Profiles (own + public) | 🔴 stub | 🔴 SAV-133, L-28 | L-6 + SAV-133 → **Slice 5** (L-33) |
| Communities (home/detail/share) | 🔴 stub | 🔴 nothing (L-27) | L-7 + L-27 → **Slice 6** (L-34) |
| Recipe images | 🔴 none | 🔴 L-29 | deferred post-core-MVP |

Human gates that no amount of agent hours can pass: Apple Developer entitlements
(L-26), Cloudflare D1/R2 provisioning (L-4/L-29), UAT feedback between slices,
Linear unblocking, contract changes.

**Planning holes — status after Dylan's 2026-07-17 decisions:**
R-1 ✅ resolved (USDA on our D1, permit held; port old-branch importer → L-37).
R-3 ✅ resolved (Communities skipped for now; tab ships "coming soon" via L-36).
R-2 deferred (cold-start content — decide before Slice 4). R-4 deferred but
required (onboarding/goals UX — no design exists and no goal-editing UI exists;
decide before L-25). R-5 folded into L-36's morning checklist.

Fillers (dispatch only if a track is idle and nothing above is eligible):
L-19 (reconcile stale planning docs), L-11 (dedupe prototype bundles — exact duplicates).

**Deliberately NOT in the overnight queue** (need Dylan or daytime attention):
- L-13 dep upgrades — coordinated Wrangler/Vitest/pool-workers bump can wedge the test rig; do it supervised.
- L-4 remote D1 provisioning — needs Cloudflare account actions/credentials.
- L-9 / L-10 — branch/dir deletion needs human sign-off.
- L-2, L-3, SAV-72, SAV-133, L-5/6/7 — next wave (Recipe Detail/publish slice and beyond); re-queue explicitly after Today UAT feedback.
- Anything touching `docs/api-contract.md` — contract changes require human approval, always.

## Last run report

**Iteration 4 (2026-07-17 ~23:05).** **L-36 LANDED (`b851a2f`) — morning
TestFlight path is fully unblocked.** Gate evidence: independent 204/204 test
run, unsigned Release archive verified (bundle com.savoro.Savoro, 0.1.0 (1),
encryption-exempt, AppIcon present), icon asset visually confirmed to be the
brand mark, coming-soon copy on the three stub tabs with banned-term regression
tests. Dylan's morning steps: SavoroIOS/TestFlightChecklist.md. L-20
redispatched fresh from post-L-36 main (stale partial pbxproj work discarded
deliberately — rebasing uncommitted pbxproj edits across L-36's project changes
risked corruption). SAV-131 (cookbook) still running on the backend track.

**Iteration 3 (2026-07-17 ~23:30, loop restarted).** Architecture per Dylan:
gpt-5.6-only task layer, single Fable orchestrator (see loop-protocol.md).
Landed: L-14 (`e86cd9b`, 78/78) and the final brand mark (`6b2bcdd` —
chef's-kiss glyph SVG + 1024 icon, visually verified). Dispatched: L-36
(TestFlight readiness, must-land) and SAV-131 (cookbook). L-20's partial work
(UI-test target wiring, a11y IDs) preserved in its worktree; resumes after
L-36 to avoid pbxproj collisions. Heartbeat re-armed.

**Iteration 2 (2026-07-17 ~22:05).** L-12 landed as `f36349b`: goal creation now
computes true inclusive overlap, rejects (422) ranges overlapping a later goal
instead of splicing, closes only earlier-starting open goals; regression asserts
no row can have `endDate < startDate`. Suite 74→78, verified independently before
and after merge. L-14 (log contract parity) dispatched. L-20 (XCUITest) still
running on the frontend track.

**Iteration 1 (2026-07-17 ~21:50).** SAV-129+L-1 landed as `705510f`: publish/
unpublish/archive endpoints per contract, real `publishedAt` (migration 0006 with
backfill), public-draft logging hole closed with regression test, plus a bonus
correctness catch — editing a draft whose version was previously published now
creates a new version, preserving log/fork immutability through unpublish→edit.
Backend suite 66→74 tests, all green, typecheck clean; independently re-verified
before and after the squash-merge. L-12 (goal ranges) dispatched to a fresh
worktree. L-20 (XCUITest scaffolding) still running on the frontend track.
Logo generation is with Dylan (OpenAI billing cap blocks gpt-image-1; four
self-contained prompts delivered).
